User Story 1: Hospital – Restricted Access for Staff

Issue:
Hospitals need a secure way to restrict access to critical areas like ICUs, operating rooms, and medical storage, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter.

Implementation Criteria:
Use RFID authentication to grant access to hospital staff.
Implement an access control system that allows administrators to add/remove staff permissions.
Store access logs to track staff movements.
Trigger alerts when unauthorized access is attempted.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The RFID scanner should verify hospital staff access before unlocking the door.
- Unauthorized RFID scans should trigger an alert for security staff.
- The system must log each entry attempt with staff credentials and timestamps.
- Administrators should have remote control to grant or revoke access.

How the User Benefits:
- Secure Access – Only authorized hospital staff can enter restricted areas.
- Accountability – Access logs track movements for safety.
- Improved Security – Unauthorized entry attempts trigger alerts.
- Flexible Control – Admins can add or remove access privileges remotely.
